Maybe a bit too lengthy but consuming this as an audiobook means I can half concentrate and I still get the broad strokes of things.<br/><br/>Some things I took away:<br/>- the importance of having a vision!! It's so powerful to be able to imagine what the world could be like beyond the limits of what is currently possible then work towards it.<br/>- relentless pursuit of simplicity ! Making products that are so intuitive you don't need instructions or complicated steps. Things just happen. <br/>- building your product based on other products limits what you're able to do - but going around this also means being willing to invest in building every part of your product from scratch. If you have a strong sense of your core product, you'll make a better informed decision on whats worth it (related to having a vision!)<br/>- seamless integration!! In a world where it pays to specialise, it's becoming more valuable to specialise in workflows from end to end as opposed to making specific tasks generalisable. (Think: being the best burger restaurant as opposed to the best patty supplier)<br/>- there is power in confidence, especially to others. Lots of people are often waiting for ""permission"" to do things and when you give it to them, they can move mountains.<br/>- As with many of these insane people, I'd hate it if readers were to takeaway that being an asshole is the key to success -- you can be kind while being tough, honest without being malicious and confident without being cocky.",,,1,0

I particularly enjoyed the way she summarised research and reframed it to how applicable it is to her life or cautions with the specific assumptions the research was made under. I gobbled up the audiobook and felt my perspective change.<br/><br/>Here's what I took away:<br/>1. Just because you 'tried therapy' and it didn't work, doesn't mean that therapy doesn't work for you. Sometimes it just means that the therapist or the method didn't address your needs.<br/>2. You need to process how you feel and accept those feelings as they come along. You can't just shut feelings out.<br/>3. It's okay to feel sad especially right after particularly amazing days. It's a natural response that you want more amazing days but you shouldn't beat yourself up for feeling that way. Accept it and let go.<br/>4. Curiosity! A way to practice active listening. Understand why you reacted in certain ways -- ask questions from a place of kindness. And when you have the emotional availability, do this for your loved ones too. Everyone has insecurities, doubts - help them work through it, ask them questions to understand how they feel.<br/>5. Taking care of your mental health is taking care of your physical health. They are intertwined!<br/>6. One way to better understand your emotions is to make sure you're taking care of yourself (eat well, drink water, sleep enough, exercise). Then, you can begin to discern where your feelings are coming from.<br/><br/>I'd love to re-read this book after I've digested it.

There is a note of happily ever after, I suppose I'm just hung up on the ever after. <br/><br/>I guess what I'm trying to say is, the characters had a lot of potential to be developed further! <br/><br/><br/>But that isn't to say you shouldn't read the book. I loved the pacing of the story, it reads really well. I love the representation of platonic friendships in a YA novel. With the mainstream of relationships in YA it almost seems as though romantic love is the default form for the main characters to take. Love has always been central to the equation. But it's beautiful to imagine a universe where it doesn't have to be. Where you could love fiercely without the sexual attraction, where you could feel warmed by a relationship without the romance.",true,,2,0

I still find John annoying even though this is already the fifth book. Nine's charm that I found interesting in the second and third book now make him look like a douche. I won't go onto a hate rampage, but I suppose the underlying reason is that I feel like the characters haven't been developed well enough. There is not enough time invested to their thought process and emotions as each individual character. After all, we mostly only get a glimpse of John or Six, but even with the extra exposure to how they think I still can't quite grasp them as real people. The story itself is interesting and I enjoy the concept of it. However, at one point of the book when Setrakus Ra arrives in New York at the last few chapters and becomes so overtly distraught that this part of his plan has been foiled I felt underwhelmed by the situation. It felt so out of character and forced (probably because the antagonist of the series feels kinda one dimensional to begin with). <br/><br/>All in all, not the greatest series, but I will finish it because I bought the box set HAHA",true,,2,0

In this case it's an unbearable sadness at the reality of it all from what the characters are going through. The emotions and ideas he conveys are powerful and relatable. I'm crying from how this book has touched something in my heart. <br/><br/>The thing about Patrick Ness is that from reading the Monsters of Men trilogy and A Monster Calls is that his stories take on their own lives. It's never about just writing a book to live out the fantasy, it's about writing about a life to live out its meaning. It's really difficult to explain how I feel about his stories but they always leave me in a book hangover state for a while. <br/><br/>This book contrary to what many reviews seem to be saying isn't boring because it's about the non-supernatural kids. It's amazing because it's about how supernatural they can be in their own way. ",,,1,0
